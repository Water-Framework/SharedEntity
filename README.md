## SharedEntity

### Overview

The SharedEntity project provides a robust and flexible mechanism for managing shared access to entities within the Water ecosystem. It enables controlled sharing of resources between users, with fine-grained permissions managed through roles. This project is essential for applications requiring collaborative access to data and resources, ensuring both security and ease of management. The core value proposition lies in its ability to simplify the process of sharing entities, enforce access control policies, and provide a clear audit trail of sharing activities. The `SharedEntity` repository specifically focuses on the API, model, service, and related components necessary for managing the sharing of entities. This includes defining the data structures, interfaces, business logic, and persistence mechanisms required for the system to function effectively.

#### Module Usage

*   **SharedEntity-api:** This module defines the core interfaces for interacting with the SharedEntity functionality. To use this module in your project, add it as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        implementation project(':SharedEntity-api')
    }
    ```

    You can then use the interfaces defined in this module to interact with the SharedEntity service. For example, you can inject the `SharedEntityApi` interface into your service and use it to manage shared entities.

*   **SharedEntity-model:** This module defines the data model for SharedEntity. To use this module in your project, add it as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        implementation project(':SharedEntity-model')
    }
    ```

    You can then use the classes defined in this module to represent shared entities in your application. For example, you can create instances of the `WaterSharedEntity` class to represent shared entities and pass them to the methods defined in the `SharedEntityApi` interface.

*   **SharedEntity-service:** This module implements the core business logic for SharedEntity. To use this module in your project, add it as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        implementation project(':SharedEntity-service')
    }
    ```

    You will also need to configure the necessary dependencies, such as the database connection and the user integration client. Once you have configured the dependencies, you can use the classes defined in this module to manage shared entities in your application.

*   **SharedEntity-service-spring:** This module implements the SharedEntity service using Spring. To use this module in your project, add it as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        implementation project(':SharedEntity-service-spring')
    }
    ```

    You will also need to configure the necessary Spring beans, such as the data source and the JPA entity manager. Once you have configured the Spring beans, you can use the classes defined in this module to manage shared entities in your application.

**Minimal Usage Patterns:**

To register the SharedEntity service, you will need to ensure that the necessary components are properly configured and registered within the Water ecosystem. This typically involves:

*   Defining the necessary Spring beans in your application context (for `SharedEntity-service-spring`).
*   Registering the REST endpoints with the appropriate JAX-RS or Spring MVC configuration.
*   Configuring the data source and JPA entity manager to connect to the database.
*   Setting up the user integration client to retrieve user information from the user management system.
*   Configuring the permission manager to enforce access control policies.

**Example Integration Scenario:**

Let's assume you have an existing Water-based application and want to integrate the `SharedEntity-service-spring` module to manage shared access to custom entities.

1.  **Add the dependency:** Include `SharedEntity-service-spring` in your application's `build.gradle` file as shown above.
2.  **Configure Spring:** In your Spring configuration (e.g., `applicationContext.xml` or a `@Configuration` class), define the necessary beans:

    ```java
    @Configuration
    @EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = "it.water.shared.entity.repository")
    @ComponentScan(basePackages = "it.water.shared.entity.service")
    public class SharedEntityConfig {

        @Bean
        public DataSource dataSource() {
            // Configure your data source (e.g., HSQLDB, PostgreSQL)
            DriverManagerDataSource dataSource = new DriverManagerDataSource();
            dataSource.setDriverClassName("org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver");
            dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:hsqldb:mem:testdb");
            dataSource.setUsername("sa");
            dataSource.setPassword("");
            return dataSource;
        }

        @Bean
        public LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean entityManagerFactory() {
            LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean em = new LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean();
            em.setDataSource(dataSource());
            em.setPackagesToScan("it.water.shared.entity.model");

            JpaVendorAdapter vendorAdapter = new HibernateJpaVendorAdapter();
            em.setJpaVendorAdapter(vendorAdapter);
            return em;
        }

        @Bean
        public PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager(EntityManagerFactory emf) {
            JpaTransactionManager transactionManager = new JpaTransactionManager();
            transactionManager.setEntityManagerFactory(emf);
            return transactionManager;
        }
    }
    ```

3.  **Configure application.properties:** Set up the database connection details and other properties in your `application.properties` file:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
    spring.datasource.username=sa
    spring.datasource.password=
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:hsqldb:mem:testdb
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
    server.servlet.context-path=/water
    water.testMode=false
    ```

4.  **Use the API:** Inject the `SharedEntityApi` into your application components and use it to manage shared entities:

    ```java
    @Service
    public class MyEntityService {

        @Autowired
        private SharedEntityApi sharedEntityApi;

        public void shareEntity(String entityResourceName, long entityId, long userId) {
            WaterSharedEntity sharedEntity = new WaterSharedEntity();
            sharedEntity.setEntityResourceName(entityResourceName);
            sharedEntity.setEntityId(entityId);
            sharedEntity.setUserId(userId);
            sharedEntityApi.save(sharedEntity);
        }
    }
    ```

This example demonstrates how to integrate the `SharedEntity-service-spring` module into an existing Water application, configure the necessary Spring beans, and use the `SharedEntityApi` to manage shared entities.

### Functional Analysis

#### 1. Main Responsibilities of the System

The primary responsibility of the SharedEntity system is to manage and control the sharing of entities between users within the Water ecosystem. This includes:

*   **Storing sharing information:** Persisting records of which entities are shared with which users, including the associated roles and permissions.
*   **Providing APIs for managing sharing:** Offering interfaces for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting shared entity records.
*   **Enforcing access control:** Ensuring that users can only access entities that have been explicitly shared with them, and only with the granted permissions.
*   **Providing query capabilities:** Allowing applications to easily find entities shared with a specific user or users who have access to a specific entity.
*   **Integrating with user management:** Leveraging a user integration client to retrieve user information and ensure that only valid users can be granted access.

The system provides foundational services for managing shared access, including a data model for representing shared entities, a repository for persisting sharing information, and a service layer for implementing the business logic.

#### 2. Problems the System Solves

The SharedEntity system addresses the following problems:

*   **Centralized sharing management:** Provides a single point of control for managing shared access to entities, simplifying the process and reducing the risk of inconsistencies.
*   **Fine-grained access control:** Enables administrators to grant specific permissions to users, ensuring that they only have access to the resources they need.
*   **Simplified integration:** Offers a well-defined API that can be easily integrated into existing applications, reducing the development effort required to implement sharing functionality.
*   **Auditing and tracking:** Provides a clear audit trail of sharing activities, allowing administrators to track who has access to which entities and when access was granted.
*   **Scalability:** Designed to handle a large number of shared entities and users, ensuring that the system can scale to meet the needs of growing applications.

For example, consider a document management system where users need to collaborate on documents. The SharedEntity system can be used to manage shared access to documents, allowing users to grant specific permissions to other users (e.g., read-only, edit, comment). This ensures that users can only access documents that have been explicitly shared with them, and only with the granted permissions.

#### 3. Interaction of Modules and Components

The SharedEntity system consists of several modules and components that interact to provide the overall functionality:

*   **API Layer:** Defines the interfaces for interacting with the SharedEntity functionality. This layer provides a clear contract for how applications can access and manage shared entities.
*   **Model Layer:** Defines the data structures used throughout the project. This layer ensures that all components are working with the same data model, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.
*   **Service Layer:** Implements the business logic and orchestrates the interactions between the API layer, the repository layer, and other services. This layer provides the core functionality of the system, including managing shared entities, enforcing access control policies, and integrating with other services.
*   **Repository Layer:** Handles data access and persistence. This layer provides an abstraction over the underlying database, allowing the system to easily switch between different database implementations.
*   **REST Controller Layer:** Exposes the SharedEntity functionality as REST endpoints. This layer allows applications to access the SharedEntity functionality over the network, making it easy to integrate with other systems.

The `SharedEntityServiceImpl` class acts as the central component, coordinating the interactions between the different layers. It uses the `SharedEntityRepository` to access the database, the `UserIntegrationClient` to retrieve user information, and the `PermissionManager` to enforce access control policies. The REST controllers delegate requests to the `SharedEntityServiceImpl`, which then performs the necessary operations and returns the results. Dependency Injection via the Spring framework is used to manage dependencies between components, promoting loose coupling and testability.

#### 4. User-Facing vs. System-Facing Functionalities

The SharedEntity system provides both user-facing and system-facing functionalities:

*   **User-Facing Functionalities:**
    *   **REST Endpoints:** The REST endpoints exposed by the `SharedEntityRestControllerImpl` and `SharedEntitySpringRestControllerImpl` classes provide a user-facing interface for managing shared entities. These endpoints can be used by applications to create, retrieve, update, and delete shared entity records. They are the primary mechanism for end-users or applications to interact with the sharing functionality.
*   **System-Facing Functionalities:**
    *   **API Interfaces:** The API interfaces defined in the `SharedEntity-api` module provide a system-facing interface for managing shared entities. These interfaces are used by other components within the Water ecosystem to access the SharedEntity functionality.
    *   **Service Layer:** The service layer implements the core business logic for managing shared entities. This layer is used by other components within the Water ecosystem to perform operations such as saving, updating, and removing shared entity records.
    *   **Repository Layer:** The repository layer handles data access and persistence. This layer is used by the service layer to interact with the database.
    *   **Permission Management:** The permission management component enforces access control policies, ensuring that users can only access entities that have been explicitly shared with them, and only with the granted permissions.

The user-facing functionalities provide a way for end-users or applications to interact with the SharedEntity system, while the system-facing functionalities provide a way for other components within the Water ecosystem to access the SharedEntity functionality.

**Common Annotations and Behaviors:**

The `WaterSharedEntity` class systematically applies common behaviors through its fields, which represent the core attributes of a shared entity (resource name, entity ID, user ID). These fields are consistently used across all implementing or extending classes, ensuring consistent and shared functionality for managing shared entities. The consistent use of these fields ensures that all shared entities are treated uniformly throughout the system.

### Architectural Patterns and Design Principles Applied

*   **Layered Architecture:** The project follows a layered architecture, with distinct layers for API, business logic, data access, and presentation (REST). This promotes separation of concerns and improves maintainability. Each layer has a specific responsibility, and the layers interact with each other in a well-defined manner.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The Spring Framework is used to manage dependencies, promoting loose coupling and testability. Components are injected with their dependencies, rather than creating them themselves. This makes it easier to test components in isolation and to switch between different implementations.
*   **Interface-Based Programming:** The project relies heavily on interfaces to define contracts between components, allowing for flexibility and extensibility. Components interact with each other through interfaces, rather than through concrete classes. This makes it easier to switch between different implementations and to extend the system with new functionality.
*   **RESTful API:** The project exposes its functionality as REST endpoints, following the principles of RESTful architecture. RESTful APIs are stateless, scalable, and easy to integrate with other systems.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The project implements RBAC to control access to shared entities, allowing users to be assigned different roles (manager, viewer, editor) with varying levels of permissions. RBAC simplifies the process of managing permissions and ensures that users only have access to the resources they need.
*   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** The `WaterSharedEntity` class acts as a DTO, transferring data between different layers of the application. DTOs are used to encapsulate data and transfer it between different layers of the application. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred and improves performance.
*   **Persistence Abstraction:** The use of Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) provides an abstraction layer over the underlying database, allowing for easy switching between different database implementations. JPA provides a standard way to interact with databases, making it easier to switch between different database implementations without having to change the code.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests, suggesting a TDD approach to development. TDD helps to ensure that the code is correct and that it meets the requirements of the application.
*   **Interceptor Pattern:** The Core-interceptors module is used to apply cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transaction management. Interceptors are used to intercept method calls and perform actions before or after the method is executed. This helps to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
*   **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** The project follows a service-oriented architecture, with distinct services for managing shared entities, user integration, and permission management. SOA promotes loose coupling and reusability.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** The project leverages events for certain functionalities, such as notifying users when an entity is shared with them. This promotes loose coupling and scalability.

### Code Quality Analysis

The SonarQube analysis of the SharedEntity project reveals the following key metrics:

*   **Bugs:** 0 - No bugs were detected, indicating high code reliability.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** 0 - No security vulnerabilities were found, demonstrating a strong security posture.
*   **Code Smells:** 0 - No code smells were identified, suggesting clean and maintainable code.
*   **Line Coverage:** 80.3% - The test suite covers a significant portion of the codebase, indicating a good level of testing.
*   **Duplication:** 0.0% - There is no code duplication, which reflects efficient code reuse and maintainability.

These metrics indicate that the SharedEntity project has a high level of code quality, with no identified bugs, vulnerabilities, or code smells. The test coverage is also good, and there is no code duplication. This suggests that the project is well-maintained and that it is likely to be reliable and secure.
